                    <h1>DND Fan Site</h1>
                    <p>Dungeons and Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules. It has been published by Wizards of the Coast since 1997.</p>
                    <p>DND was originally derived from miniature wargames, in the same vein as the modern <i>Warhammer 40,000</i>, but it differs in the sense that you get to control your own character instead of a group of troopers. You embark on adventures in a fantasy world created by the Dungeon Master, who acts as a referee and a storyteller for the game. Together with a party, you explore, solve problems, level up, roleplay with one another, and create incredible stories.</p>
                    <p>Characters are created using character sheets - in fact, these can be found <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/resources/1779-d-d-character-sheets?srsltid=AfmBOoo4iir-jgQS4RoUWl8_UZJKH-44BN0CI1AnCmNp1fEtCk8L7K2f">here.</p>
