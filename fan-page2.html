                    <h2>History, Facts, Resources, & Impact</h2>
                    <p>As stated on the first page, Gary Gygax was inspired by miniature wargames, particularly the fantastical <i>Chainmail</i>, when originally creating <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>. With help from Dave Arneson, Gygax combined these wargames with roleplay elements throughout the late 60s and early 70s, ending with it being published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules.</p>
                    <p>The game later temporarily branched into regular D&D and AD&D (Advanced D&D), which lasted up until the 3rd edition of the game came out in 2000. More editions continued to release, including 3.5e in 2003, 4e in 2008, and finally 5e in 2014, which has remained the main edition to this day, with it getting an update/revamp known as 5.5e in 2024, which is the current edition.</p>
                    <p>There are numerous resources you can find online for D&D. I would highly recommend <a href=https://www.dndbeyond.com><i>D&D Beyond</i></a> for any potential needs for game resources - be it books, dice, character sheets, or anything else you could imagine. There are also several books I'd recommend getting if you have the money, including the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. <a href="https://anyflip.com/afgs/xkls">Or commit piracy.</a> <a href="https://online.anyflip.com/yyxst/fsfd/mobile/index.html">That works too.</a></p>
                    <p>D&D has made a major cultural impact. It's often credited as the birth of RPG games, which have become a popular genre for both tabletop gaming and video games. Many things from D&D have become commonplace in modern media, including the Lich, the Mimic, the Alignment system, the concept of a Nat 20, and numerous character class archetypes. (There was also the whole satanic panic in like the 80s but we don't need to talk about <i>THAT</i>.) In any case, the impact of D&D on pop culture and many of the things you may find yourself interested in is enormous and undeniable.</p>
